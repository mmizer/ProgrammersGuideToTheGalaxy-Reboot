### Update 11/22/2020

This is a hard fork (imported/mirror) of the original repository, found ![here](https://github.com/stuartaroth/programmersguidetothegalaxy) with original credit to ![@stuartaroth](https://github.com/stuartaroth). It's been left unmaintained for quite a few years now. We intend to actively update with modern exmaples, additional examples by use case and scenario, and perhaps expanding into DevOps topics, Cloud equivalencies, and security platforms. We'll be touching up the website with a more modern, appealing look and feel soon. 

This was a great resource a few years back while mentoring some developers less experienced in the particular stack our company was using at the time, as well as great resource for more experienced devs looking to cut through all the "boilerplate" documentation and get moving quickly in an unfamilar environment.

External collaboration is welcomed and encouraged. 

### All content below is a snapshot the original docs as it existed when we copied and will be retained as is for the time being.

##### www.programmersguidetothegalaxy.com is a project with a simple goal:
##### Allow engineers to quickly learn how to do "x" in "y" language.

While programming concepts are universal, syntax is not. This project aims to give users a tool that will allow them to get working quickly on technology stacks that are new to them.

This project can help add to your tool belt, allowing you to easily use the best libraries and frameworks for the task at hand, regardless of your current experience and knowledge.

> If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail

##### Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome! All new code should follow the established style.

Currently the focus should be adding new languages, across all the currently included folders/concepts.

New folders/concepts should try to include examples across all supported languages.

Before pull requesting, you should run the command ./run_all_examples.sh

When doing this all your code should compile and run.

Issues can be used to report bugs / request languages and folders.
